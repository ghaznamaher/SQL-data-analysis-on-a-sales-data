# "SQL-Driven Insights into Sales Performance"
Community Interaction and Badge Analytics Using SQL

This project presents an in-depth analysis of user activity and community engagement using a structured SQL database. The dataset models a Q&A platform with interconnected tables capturing users, posts, votes, comments, tags, badges, and post history. Through SQL queries, the analysis explores patterns in user contributions, post popularity, voting behavior, and badge acquisition over time. Key insights include identifying top contributors, frequently discussed SQL topics, post performance metrics, and the correlation between user engagement (e.g., comments, edits) and reputation.
